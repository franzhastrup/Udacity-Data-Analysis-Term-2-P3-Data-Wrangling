Learning the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. Python is used to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for deeper analysis. Data from several sources are collected, assessed for quality and tidiness and then cleaned. 
  
Three different datasets have been utilized for analysis. A given dataset with data from WeRateDogs posts on Twitter, a downloaded dataset using a Twitter API gathering more information on the tweets and a machine learning dataset predicting the content of the attached photos.
These have been gathered, assessed and cleaned and followed by an analysis and interpretation.
